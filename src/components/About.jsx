        Hi, I’m Lesly. I currently work as a Housing Assistant and have developed strong
        communication, organization, and problem-solving skills. I&apos;m transitioning into tech
        through the Path2TECH App Development program, where I&apos;m learning to build practical
        and user-friendly apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about using technology to create solutions that make a real impact, and I’m
        excited to keep learning, connect with others in tech, and grow as a developer.
